# Optiver_VolatilityPrediction_Project

Develop a tool that predicts future volatility of financial data and communicate the tool using multimedia to a trader.
- Conducted a comprehensive business analysis to define project objectives, followed by data collection,
preprocessing, downsampling, and cross-validation to prepare datasets for analysis.
- Developed and experimented with various time series models, including Holt-Winters, Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), ARIMA, Time Series Linear Regression, Heston, Holtâ€™s Linear Trend
Model, Autoregressive (AR), and ARIMA-GARCH.
- Utilized evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC),
running time, and model stability to assess and select the best-performing model.
- Deployed the final model using a Shiny app in R Studio, creating an interactive tool to enhance
real-time trading precision and decision-making support on the trading floor.
